# Conferences Organizer

This is the first solo project i built with the knowledge i have so far.

[You can try it here.](https://sharedfolders.github.io/conferencesorganizer/)

I spent about **one and a half days** on coding and **half a day** for styling with Tailwind CSS.

It was a very great quick self-imposed exercise about lifting and deriving states, components reusability, and working with Tailwind CSS for the first time.

Back to learning for now !
